# MCP Setup and Tool Access Verification

## Plan snippet for this mini-task
- Fix MCP configuration - Update the MCP config to properly enable shell, filesystem, and git capabilities
- Test tool access - Test that I can run commands, read files, and access git operations
- Verify project commands work - Ensure I can run the project's verification commands

## Files touched
- `/Users/tikitalks/.cursor/mcp.json` - Fixed MCP configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Fixed TypeScript configuration issue
- `ops/results/` - Created results directory

## Commands run (with return codes)
- `pwd && ls -la` - Exit code: 0 ✅
- `git status` - Exit code: 0 ✅
- `npm install -g pnpm` - Exit code: 0 ✅
- `pnpm install` - Exit code: 0 ✅
- `pnpm type-check` - Exit code: 2 (TypeScript errors, but tool access working)
- `pnpm prisma:generate` - Exit code: 0 ✅
- `pnpm lint` - Exit code: 2 (ESLint config missing, but tool access working)
- `mkdir -p ops/results` - Exit code: 0 ✅

## Key output snippets (trimmed)
- Shell access: Working ✅
- File reading: Working ✅
- Git access: Working ✅
- Package installation: Working ✅
- Prisma generation: Working ✅

## Next step / blockages
- **Tool access is fully functional** - All core tools (shell, filesystem, git) are working
- **Project has TypeScript errors** - 756 errors in 74 files, mainly due to missing type definitions and schema mismatches
- **ESLint configuration missing** - Project needs ESLint config file for v9+
- **Ready for development work** - All tools needed for efficient project work are now accessible

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All requested tools are now accessible and working properly. The project has some TypeScript and configuration issues, but the core tool access needed for efficient development is fully functional.
