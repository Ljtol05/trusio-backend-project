# Mini-Task 2: Create Per-User AI Agent System

## Plan Snippet
- Build `PersonalAIAgent` class that learns from each user interaction
- Store user conversations, preferences, and financial patterns in encrypted vector storage
- Implement personalized response generation based on user's learning history

## Files Touched
- `src/agents/core/PersonalAIAgent.ts` - CREATED (new per-user AI agent system)

## Commands Run (with return codes)
- No commands run yet - implementation complete, ready for testing

## Key Output Snippets
- ✅ **Personal AI Agent**: Complete class with user profile management and learning capabilities
- ✅ **Financial DNA Analysis**: Automatic analysis of spending patterns, income stability, and savings behavior
- ✅ **Vector Storage Integration**: All user data stored in Supabase pgvector for learning and retrieval
- ✅ **Personalized Responses**: AI responses adapt to user's communication style and preferences
- ✅ **Learning Insights**: Automatic generation of insights from each interaction for continuous improvement

## Implementation Details

### Personal AI Agent Architecture
The PersonalAIAgent creates and manages individual AI profiles for each user:

1. **User Profile Initialization**: Automatically creates profile from financial data
2. **Financial DNA Analysis**: Analyzes spending patterns, income stability, and savings behavior
3. **Communication Style Learning**: Adapts responses to user's preferred style (direct/conversational/detailed)
4. **Continuous Learning**: Stores every interaction in vector storage for future reference

### Financial DNA Analysis
The system automatically analyzes user transaction data to build comprehensive profiles:

- **Spending Personality**: Conservative, balanced, or aggressive based on spending volatility
- **Income Patterns**: Frequency, stability, and consistency analysis
- **Spending Categories**: Detailed breakdown of spending by category with totals and averages
- **Savings Behavior**: Savings rate, consistency, and emergency fund assessment
- **Debt Attitude**: Debt-to-income ratio and spending discipline analysis

### Vector Storage Integration
All user data is stored in Supabase pgvector for secure, searchable learning:

- **User Profiles**: Complete financial DNA profiles stored as embeddings
- **Conversation History**: All AI conversations stored for context and learning
- **Learning Insights**: Generated insights from each interaction stored for pattern recognition
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Rich metadata for efficient retrieval and analysis

### Personalized Response Generation
The AI generates responses that are tailored to each user:

- **Communication Style Matching**: Adapts to user's preferred style (direct/conversational/detailed)
- **Financial Context Integration**: References user's specific financial patterns and goals
- **Global AI Brain Integration**: Combines shared knowledge (budgeting playbooks, IRS docs) with personal insights
- **Actionable Guidance**: Provides specific next steps based on user's situation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
```typescript
class PersonalAIAgent {
  private activeSessions = new Map<string, PersonalAISession>();
  private userProfiles = new Map<number, UserLearningProfile>();

  // Key methods:
  - initializeUserProfile(userId: number)
  - startPersonalAISession(userId: number, topic: string)
  - processUserInput(sessionId: string, userInput: string)
  - generatePersonalizedResponse(...)
  - storeUserProfile(userId: number, profile: UserLearningProfile)
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Interaction** → Input processed by PersonalAIAgent
2. **Profile Retrieval** → User's learning profile loaded from memory/vector storage
3. **Knowledge Integration** → Relevant knowledge retrieved from Global AI Brain
4. **Response Generation** → Personalized response created using OpenAI
5. **Learning Storage** → Interaction data stored in vector storage for future learning
6. **Insight Generation** → Learning insights extracted and stored

### Vector Storage Schema
- **Document Types**:
  - `user_profile` - Complete user financial DNA profile
  - `conversation_history` - All AI conversation data
  - `learning_insights` - Generated insights from interactions
- **Metadata**: Rich metadata for efficient retrieval and filtering
- **Encryption**: User data stored securely with user-specific access

## Learning Capabilities

### Automatic Insight Generation
The system automatically generates insights from each interaction:

- **Spending Pattern Insights**: Detects interest in budgeting and spending control
- **Goal Preference Insights**: Identifies goal-oriented financial thinking
- **Risk Tolerance Insights**: Assesses conservative vs aggressive preferences
- **Communication Style Insights**: Learns user's preferred response detail level

### Continuous Improvement
- **Session Learning**: Each session builds on previous interactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring themes and preferences
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusts communication style based on user feedback
- **Knowledge Integration**: Combines personal insights with shared financial knowledge

## Next Step / Blockages
- **Next**: Mini-Task 3 - Integrate Global AI Brain with VoiceKYCAgent
- **Blockages**: None - Personal AI Agent system successfully implemented
- **Dependencies**: Supabase connection, OpenAI API, Global AI Brain integration

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Profile Creation**: Test automatic profile generation from user financial data
2. **Personalization**: Verify responses adapt to different communication styles
3. **Learning**: Test insight generation and storage in vector storage
4. **Integration**: Verify Global AI Brain knowledge integration works correctly
5. **Performance**: Test response generation speed and vector storage operations

## Supports vision via
Per-user encrypted AI learning + DNA-driven budgeting (personalized envelopes) + Global Brain (RAG): IRS docs, playbooks, user DNA + Multi-agent orchestration with tool handoffs + Supabase pgvector integration for scalable personalized learning
