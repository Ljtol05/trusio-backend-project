Key Features:
âœ… Middleware Stack: Complete request/response lifecycle management
âœ… Enhanced Endpoints: Agent-powered features for existing APIs
âœ… Error Handling: Comprehensive error catching and formatting
âœ… Health Monitoring: System status and metrics endpoints
âœ… Response Standardization: Consistent API response formats
âœ… Request Validation: Zod-based validation for agent requests
âœ… Context Management: User session and financial context tracking

New API Endpoints Added:
GET /api/agents/health - System health check
GET /api/agents/metrics - Performance metrics
POST /api/envelopes/suggestions - AI-powered envelope suggestions
POST /api/envelopes/:id/optimize - Envelope optimization
POST /api/transactions/categorize - AI transaction categorization
GET /api/transactions/analysis - Spending pattern analysis
POST /api/transfers/optimize - Transfer optimization advice
The integration layer provides a seamless bridge between our multi-agent system and the existing REST API, enabling AI-powered features while maintaining backward compatibility and proper error handling.

PROCEED to the next task when ready!
