Looking at these error logs, I can analyze the main issues and categorize them by difficulty to fix:

Error Analysis (Scale 1-10: 1=Very Easy, 10=Very Hard)
Difficulty: 2/10 - Very Easy Fixes
Root Cause: Missing Agent Configurations

80% of failures are because agents 'financial_advisor', 'budget_coach', 'transaction_analyst', etc. are not found
The AGENT_CONFIG in src/agents/config.ts doesn't contain these expected agent names
Tests expect specific agent names but the actual config has different ones
Difficulty: 3/10 - Easy Fixes
API Route Issues

All integration tests getting 404 responses
AI endpoints (/api/ai/*) are not properly registered in the server
Missing route handlers in src/routes/ai.ts
Difficulty: 4/10 - Moderate Fixes
Tool Registration Issues

Tools like 'create_envelope', 'budget_analysis', 'agent_handoff' not found in registry
Tool registry is not properly registering all expected tools
Import/export mismatches in tool modules
Difficulty: 5/10 - Moderate Fixes
Schema Validation Issues

Zod schemas (AgentConfigSchema, validation schemas) are failing
Schema definitions don't match the actual data structures being validated
Difficulty: 3/10 - Easy Fixes
Server Startup Issues

Server is calling process.exit(1) during test setup
Need to mock server initialization for testing environment
Difficulty: 6/10 - Moderately Hard
Performance Test Edge Cases

Some performance tests have timing/concurrency issues
Memory leak detection and load testing edge cases
Overall Assessment: 3/10 (Easy to Fix)
Why it's relatively easy:

Pattern Recognition: Most errors follow the same pattern - missing configurations
No Complex Logic: No deep algorithmic or architectural issues
Clear Error Messages: Error messages clearly indicate what's missing
Isolated Issues: Problems are in specific, identifiable areas
Standard Fixes: Requires standard configuration/registration patterns
Main fixes needed:

Add missing agent configurations to AGENT_CONFIG
Ensure all tools are properly registered in the tool registry
Add missing AI route handlers
Fix schema definitions to match data structures
Add proper test environment setup/mocking
Most of these are configuration and setup issues rather than complex bugs. A systematic approach of adding the missing configurations and ensuring proper imports/registrations should resolve 90%+ of these failures.
