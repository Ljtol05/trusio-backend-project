LEFT OFF AT TASK 7 Based on the OpenAI Agents SDK documentation and your comprehensive plan, I'll break down the implementation of the full multi-agent system into separate, manageable tasks. Here are all the tasks I will execute in order:
Task Breakdown for Multi-Agent System Implementation
Phase 1: Core Agent Infrastructure (Tasks 1-4)
Task 1: Install OpenAI Agents SDK and Core Dependencies
* Install @openai/agents package
* Update TypeScript configuration for agent compatibility
* Set up proper environment variables for agent functionality
Task 2: Create Base Agent Configuration System
* Create agent configuration utilities
* Set up agent context types and interfaces
* Implement shared agent tools and utilities
Task 3: Implement Core Financial Coaching Agents
* Create OnboardingAgent for user intake and envelope setup
* Create BudgetCoachAgent for ongoing financial advice
* Create TransactionAgent for real-time transaction routing
* Create CrisisAgent for emergency financial assistance
Task 4: Build Agent Handoff System
* Implement intelligent routing between agents
* Create context preservation across handoffs
* Set up escalation paths and fallback mechanisms
Phase 2: Enhanced Tools and Memory (Tasks 5-7)
Task 5: Create Agent Tool System
* Implement envelope management tools
* Create analytics and reporting tools
* Build notification and alert tools
Task 6: Implement User Memory and Context System
* Create conversation memory storage
* Build financial profile management
* Implement preference learning system
Task 7: Build Agent Memory Integration
* Connect agents to user memory system
* Implement context-aware responses
* Create goal tracking and progress monitoring
Phase 3: Advanced Features and Security (Tasks 8-10)
Task 8: Implement Guardrails and Security
* Create input validation guardrails
* Implement output verification system
* Build financial advice safety checks
Task 9: Create Proactive Intelligence System
* Implement background spending analysis
* Build predictive alert system
* Create opportunity detection engine
Task 10: Build Real-time Streaming and Voice Support
* Integrate OpenAI Responses API for streaming
* Implement voice-enabled coaching sessions
* Create real-time transaction processing
Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Tasks 11-12)
Task 11: Integrate Multi-Agent System with Existing API
* Update existing AI routes to use new agent system
* Implement backward compatibility
* Create migration path from current system
Task 12: Create Agent Management Dashboard and Testing
* Build agent monitoring and debugging tools
* Implement comprehensive testing suite
* Create agent performance analytics

Each task will be implemented with:
* Detailed code implementation
* Proper error handling and fallbacks
* Integration with your existing Prisma database
* Comprehensive TypeScript types
* Full compatibility with your current system
The implementation will leverage your existing:
* OpenAI configuration and API setup
* Prisma database schema and user management
* Authentication and authorization system
* Envelope budgeting logic and transaction processing
